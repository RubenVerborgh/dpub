# Draft Outreach Materials for the Digital Publishing Activity

This repository stores the draft for public presentations and blogs prepared as outreach materials for the Digital Publishing Activity. While the final material is stored, for safer archival, on the W3C site (usually somewhere under ``http://www.w3.org/201X/Talks``), the drafting (and possible later reuse) can be done through this repository, together with colleagues who do not necessarily have an access to the W3C Web site.

The materials on this repo are:

* [Presentation of Tzviya Siegman and Ivan Herman](http://w3c.github.io/dpub/ebookcraft-2015-03/index.html) at the [eBookCraft conference, March 2015, Toronto](http://www.cvent.com/events/tech-forum-2015/agenda-0c06ff814cdd41b2bf8eaf40ea9ef709.aspx). (Sources in ``ebookcraft-2015-03``.)
